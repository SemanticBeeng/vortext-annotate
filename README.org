From the Old Norse word spá or spæ referring to prophesying and which is cognate with the present English word "spy," continuing Proto-Germanic *spah- and the Proto-Indo-European root *(s)peḱ (to see, to observe) --- [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%B6lva][vǫlva (wikipedia)]]

* Introduction
Unstructured PDF documents remain the main vehicle for dissemination of scientific findings.
Those interested in gathering and assimilating data must therefore manually peruse published articles and extract from these the elements of interest.
Evidence-based medicine provides a compelling illustration of this: many person-hours are spent each year extracting summary information from articles that describe clinical trials.
Machine learning provides a potential means of mitigating this burden by automating extraction.
But, for automated approaches to be useful to end-users, we need tools that allow domain experts to interact with, and benefit from, model predictions.
To this end, we present an web-based tool called Spá that accepts as input an article and provides as output an automatically visually annotated rendering of this article.
More generally, Spá provides a framework for visualizing predictions, both at the document and sentence level, for full-text PDFs.

* Example
You can try the visualizer at [[http://spa.clinici.co]] and use one of the Randomized Clinical Trials from the [[https://github.com/joelkuiper/spa/tree/master/examples][examples]] folder.

* Technical overview
Spá relies on [[http://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js][Mozilla PDF.js]] for visualization of the document and text extraction.
The results of the text extraction are processed server-side.
Results are communicated back to the browser and displayed using [[http://facebook.github.io/react][React]].

For each of the annotations the relevant nodes in the document are highlighted and a custom scrollbar, inspired by [[http://substance.io/beta/][substance.io]], that acts as a mini-map is projected to show where it resides within the document.
The user can interactively activate and inspect specific results.

* Development prerequisites
  - Python >= 2.7 (for packages see [[https://github.com/joelkuiper/spa/blob/master/requirements.txt][requirements.txt]])
  - For minified deployment [[https://github.com/jrburke/r.js][r.js]]

* Future work
