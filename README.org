From the Old Norse word spá or spæ referring to prophesying and which is cognate with the present English word "spy," continuing Proto-Germanic *spah- and the Proto-Indo-European root *(s)peḱ (to see, to observe) and consequently related to Latin specio ("(I) see") and Sanskrit spáçati and páçyati ("(s/he) sees", etc.) --- [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%B6lva][vǫlva (wikipedia)]]
