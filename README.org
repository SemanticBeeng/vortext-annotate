#+BEGIN_QUOTE
From the Old Norse word spá or spæ referring to prophesying and which is cognate with the present English word "spy," continuing Proto-Germanic *spah- and the Proto-Indo-European root *(s)peḱ (to see, to observe) --- [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%B6lva][vǫlva (wikipedia)]]

* Introduction
  Unstructured PDF documents remain the main vehicle for dissemination of scientific findings.
  Those interested in gathering and assimilating data must therefore manually peruse published articles and extract from these the elements of interest.
  Evidence-based medicine provides a compelling illustration of this: many person-hours are spent each year extracting summary information from articles that describe clinical trials.
  Machine learning provides a potential means of mitigating this burden by automating extraction.

  But, for automated approaches to be useful to end-users, we need tools that allow domain experts to interact with, and benefit from, model predictions.
  To this end, we present an web-based tool called Spá that accepts as input an article and provides as output an automatically visually annotated rendering of this article.
  More generally, Spá provides a framework for visualizing predictions, both at the document and sentence level, for full-text PDFs.

* Example
  You can try the visualizer at [[http://spa.clinici.co]] and use one of the Randomized Clinical Trials from the [[https://github.com/joelkuiper/spa/tree/master/examples][examples]] folder.

* Technical overview
** Server side
   The server-side is written on the principles of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyglot_%28computing%29][polyglot programming]] by using graphs as an abstraction of computing.
   In essence, it's a poor-mans [[https://storm.incubator.apache.org/][Apache Storm]].

** Client side
   Spá relies on [[http://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js][Mozilla PDF.js]] for visualization of the document and text extraction.
   The results of the text extraction are processed server-side.
   Results are communicated back to the browser and displayed using [[http://facebook.github.io/react][React]].

   For each of the annotations the relevant nodes in the document are highlighted and a custom scrollbar, inspired by [[http://substance.io/beta/][substance.io]], that acts as a mini-map is projected to show where it resides within the document.
   The user can interactively activate and inspect specific results.

* Development prerequisites
** Mac OS X
   The server-side is written in [[http://clojure.org/][Clojure]]. To develop the server we require [[%20http://leiningen.org/][leiningen]] which can be installed with [[http://brew.sh/][Homebrew]].
   Spa requires at least Java JVM/JDK 1.7 and Leiningen 2.2.
   PDF.js is included as a git submodule.

   #+BEGIN_SRC
 git clone <this repo>
 cd <your folder>
 git submodule init
 git submodule update
 cd resources/pdfjs

 brew update # make sure you have recent versions
 brew install node # install nodejs via Homebrew
 # Compile the PDF.js files
 node make singlefile generic dist
   #+END_SRC

   For the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call][RPC]] functionality we rely on [[http://zeromq.org/][ZeroMQ]] with JSON as the default serialization format.

   #+BEGIN_SRC
 brew install zeromq
 pip install protobuf pyzmq argparse # and other dependencies by the topology
 npm -g install underscore q zmq atob commander protobufjs
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC
 brew install leiningen # install via Homebrew
 lein deps # retrieve project dependencies
 lein run -- start # will run the server
 DEBUG=true lein run -- start # will run in debug mode
   #+END_SRC

   The requirements for the evidence-based medicine processing topology are specified within that directory.
